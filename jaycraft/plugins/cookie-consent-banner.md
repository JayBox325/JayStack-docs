# Cookie consent banner

For a basic cookie warning banner, I have included the [Cookie Consent Banner](https://plugins.craftcms.com/cookie-consent-banner) from Adigital.

The only configuration required for this plugin is in the CMS dashboard. It's best to review this once the front end development for your project is well underway so you can easily match the banner with your website.
