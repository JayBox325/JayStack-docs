# Getting started

## Preparation

Before we download JayCraft we need to prepare your environment with a new local MAMP host (if you're using MAMP) for this project and a local database.

## Create project with Composer

To start with JayCraft simply run the following command in the directory you'd like to set up a CraftCMS instance:

```
composer create-project jaybox325/jaycraft
```

This will download everything needed to get your CraftCMS project up and running.

## Update MAMP

Once your JayCraft project is built, you will need to update your project MAMP host to point at your new JayCraft `/public` directory as root.
